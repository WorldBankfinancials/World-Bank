# World Bank Digital Banking Platform

## Overview

This project is a full-stack, secure digital banking platform designed with a mobile-first approach. It provides comprehensive international banking services, featuring a React frontend, Express.js backend, and Supabase for authentication and data management. The platform supports multi-language functionality (English and Chinese), real-time features, and includes both customer-facing interfaces and administrative tools. The business vision is to deliver a robust, scalable, and secure banking solution with significant market potential in the digital finance sector.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Technical approach: Hybrid system - professional banking UI + real Supabase backend functionality.

## System Architecture

The platform uses a modern web stack with a focus on performance, security, and scalability.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System:** Mobile-first approach with a professional banking UI.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom World Bank branding and Shadcn/ui component library for a consistent and modern look.
- **Localization:** Multi-language support (English and Chinese) for international users.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend:** React 18 with TypeScript for type safety, Vite for fast development, Wouter for lightweight routing, TanStack Query for server state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for robust form handling.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API services.
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) is used as the primary database with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for enhanced data protection. Drizzle ORM ensures type-safe database operations.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth is integrated for user authentication, complemented by custom user profiles and PIN-based transaction security.
- **Key Features:**
    - **User Management:** Multi-step registration with identity verification, comprehensive user profiles, admin-managed verification.
    - **Banking Operations:** Support for multiple account types, multi-currency, international transfers with compliance features, and transaction processing with admin approval workflows.
    - **Administrative Tools:** Admin dashboard for customer management, transaction monitoring and approval, live chat support, and compliance management.
    - **Security:** Multi-factor authentication, RLS, secure transaction processing, and comprehensive audit logging.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Data Flow:** Structured flows for user registration, transactions, and authentication, including admin approval steps and real-time notifications.
- **Database Schema:** Comprehensive UUID-based banking schema including tables for users, accounts, transactions, cards, messages, beneficiaries, account statements, and alerts, all with RLS, indexes, and foreign key constraints.

## External Dependencies

- **Supabase:** Used for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and real-time features.
- **Drizzle ORM:** Provides type-safe object-relational mapping for database interactions.
- **TanStack Query (React Query):** Manages server state and data caching in the frontend.
- **React Hook Form & Zod:** Utilized for form handling and validation.
- **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of reusable UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite:** A build tool and development server for the frontend.
- **Node.js & Express.js:** Backend runtime and web application framework.
- **TypeScript:** For static type checking across the entire codebase.

## Recent Changes

### October 27, 2025 (Night Session) - PRODUCTION SECURITY HARDENING & API EXPANSION

**üîê SECURITY STATUS: DEVELOPMENT-READY, REQUIRES AUTHENTICATION FOR PRODUCTION**

**COMPLETED SECURITY FIXES:**
- **‚úÖ Hardcoded Secrets Eliminated**: Removed SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY fallback (server/supabase-public-storage.ts:26)
  - Added strict environment variable validation - throws error if secrets missing
  - Zero hardcoded credentials remaining in codebase
- **‚úÖ Admin Endpoints Protected**: Added production guards to 7 dangerous endpoints
  - /api/create-test-user, /api/admin/create-transaction, /api/admin/accounts/:id/balance
  - /api/admin/customers/:id/balance, /api/admin/customers/:id, /api/admin/transactions, /api/admin/pending-registrations
  - All return 404 if NODE_ENV === 'production'
- **‚úÖ Code Cleanup**: Deleted server/routes.ts (2048-line duplicate file)
- **‚úÖ LSP Error Reduction**: 339 ‚Üí 1 errors (99.7% reduction)

**üìä NEW API ENDPOINTS** (16 routes added to server/fix-routes.ts):
- **Cards API**: GET /api/cards, GET /api/cards/:id, POST /api/cards/lock
- **Investments API**: GET /api/investments, GET /api/investments/:id
- **Messages API**: GET /api/messages, GET /api/messages/user/:userId, POST /api/messages, PATCH /api/messages/:id/read
- **Alerts API**: GET /api/alerts, GET /api/alerts/unread, POST /api/alerts, PATCH /api/alerts/:id/read

**üíæ STORAGE LAYER EXPANSION** (16 methods across 3 implementations):
- server/storage.ts: Added IStorage interface methods
- server/postgres-storage.ts: PostgreSQL backend implementation
- server/mem-storage.ts: In-memory storage implementation
- server/supabase-public-storage.ts: Supabase client implementation (fixed from `sql` to `.from().select()` syntax)

**üö® CRITICAL: REMAINING SECURITY ISSUES FOR PRODUCTION**
1. **User Data Endpoints Unprotected** (HIGH SEVERITY)
   - /api/user (line 115) - Returns full profile with just email query parameter
   - /api/user/profile (line 135) - Returns full profile with just email in body  
   - /api/accounts (line 384) - Returns all accounts/balances with just email
   - **Risk**: Anyone who knows/guesses an email can steal PII and financial data
   - **Required Fix**: Implement Supabase JWT authentication middleware

2. **NODE_ENV Guards Insufficient** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
   - Admin routes protected only by environment variable check
   - **Risk**: If NODE_ENV misconfigured in staging/production, routes wide open
   - **Required Fix**: Replace with role-based access control using Supabase sessions

**‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS:**
- UUID/Integer mismatch: Cards API uses integer user_id (working), but investments/messages/alerts use UUID (returns empty for integer userId)
- Future work: Migrate session management to UUID-based user identification

**‚úÖ APPLICATION STATUS**: Running successfully on port 5000 with zero runtime errors

**üìã PRODUCTION SECURITY ROADMAP:**
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement Supabase JWT verification middleware
- [ ] Phase 2: Add session-based authentication to all user endpoints
- [ ] Phase 3: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin routes
- [ ] Phase 4: Replace NODE_ENV guards with proper admin role checks
- [ ] Phase 5: Add request rate limiting and IP-based protection
- [ ] Phase 6: Security audit and penetration testing
