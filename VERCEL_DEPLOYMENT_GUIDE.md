# World Bank Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Complete Database Schema Created
Your complete Supabase database schema is ready in `COMPLETE_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Setup
1. Go to your [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Open project: `icbsxmrmorkdgxtumamu`
3. Click **SQL Editor** 
4. Copy all contents from `COMPLETE_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
5. Paste and click **Run**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel
Add these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://icbsxmrmorkdgxtumamu.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Vercel Specific
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Deployment Configuration
Your `vercel.json` is already configured:
- ✅ Static build with npm run build
- ✅ API routes pointing to /dist/index.js
- ✅ Frontend serving from /dist/public
- ✅ Node.js 20.x runtime

### 4. Build Process
The build command does:
1. Install client dependencies
2. Build React frontend (TypeScript + Vite)
3. Bundle server (Express + TypeScript)
4. Copy frontend to dist/public
5. Create optimized production bundle

### 5. What Gets Deployed
```
