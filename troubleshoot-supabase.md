# Troubleshooting Your Current Supabase Instance

## Issue Identified
Your Supabase project URL `sgxmfpirkjlomzfaqqzr.supabase.co` cannot be resolved by DNS.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. Project Paused (Most Likely)
Supabase pauses projects on the free tier after inactivity.

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Find your project "sgxmfpirkjlomzfaqqzr"
3. If it shows "Paused", click "Resume Project"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for the project to wake up

### 2. Project Deleted or Renamed
Check if the project still exists in your dashboard.

**Solution:**
- If deleted: Create new project with the schema I prepared
- If renamed: Update your .env file with the new URL

### 3. Temporary DNS Issue
Sometimes there are temporary connectivity issues.

**Solution:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes and try again
- Check [Supabase Status](https://status.supabase.com/)

## Quick Check Steps

1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Look for your project

2. **If Project Exists but Paused:**
   - Click "Resume Project" 
   - Your existing database and auth setup will be preserved
   - No need to create a new project

3. **If Project Missing:**
   - Use the schema and setup guide I created
   - Your professional banking UI will work with any Supabase instance
