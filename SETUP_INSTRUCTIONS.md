# Real Supabase Banking System Setup

## Current Status
Your Supabase project is restored but may need DNS propagation time. Here are immediate steps to get your real banking system working:

## Option 1: Verify Current Project Settings

1. **Check Project Status**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sgxmfpirkjlomzfaqqzr
   - Ensure project shows as "Active" (not "Paused")
   - If still paused, click "Resume" and wait 3-5 minutes

2. **Update Project URL (if changed)**
   - In Settings → API, check if your Project URL is still: `https://sgxmfpirkjlomzfaqqzr.supabase.co`
   - If different, update your `.env` file with the new URL

3. **Database Setup**
   - Go to SQL Editor → New Query
   - Copy and run the SQL from `setup-banking-database.sql`
   - This creates the banking tables with proper UUIDs

## Option 2: Quick New Project (Alternative)

If DNS issues persist, create a fresh project:

1. **Create New Project**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name: "world-bank-live"
   - Set strong password

2. **Get New Credentials**
   - Copy Project URL
   - Copy anon/public key
   - Copy service role key

3. **Update Environment**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_new_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_service_key
   ```

4. **Run Database Schema**
   - Use the SQL from `setup-banking-database.sql`

## Real Banking Features Ready

Once connected, you'll have:
- ✅ Real Supabase authentication with UUIDs
- ✅ Professional banking database (accounts, transactions, users)
- ✅ Live notifications and chat system
- ✅ Row Level Security for data protection
- ✅ Auto-generated account numbers and IBANs
- ✅ Transaction approval workflow

## Enable Real-Time Features

After database setup:
1. Settings → API → Real-time
2. Enable for tables: `messages`, `alerts`, `transactions`

Your banking UI will work with authentic data and real-time updates.

## Which Option Do You Prefer?

C) Check current project settings first
